# Current Project State and Handoff

Status: Tier-1 mutable working-state snapshot. Repository policy/code/tests and live Runtime/GitHub evidence remain authoritative over chat history. Completed chronology belongs in Tier-3 history, not here.

Last updated: 2026-09-29 for #363 legacy auto-required verification PM review.

## Resume order

1. Read repository-root `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/project/README.md`.
3. Read this compact current-state snapshot.
4. Retrieve only the T2 topical documents and T3 episodes relevant to the current task.
5. Inspect live GitHub `main`, active issue/PR, local branch/worktree, Runtime/executor health and any current lease/job before mutation.
6. Fetch raw CI/log/transcript evidence only when the task requires diagnostics or audit.

Memory-tier rules and the proposed Context Composer contract are in `context-memory-architecture.md`. Historical platform lessons are indexed in `history/episodes.md`.

## Current platform snapshot

- Checked-out `origin/main` baseline: `d350d1989d02fb8f40cb856ace5e66d26d32c663` (#358 merged via PR #361).
- Current checked-out source identities on `ai/363-legacy-auto-required-verification`
  (not rolled out):
  - Runtime `1.0.70`;
  - Router `1.0.30`;
  - routing policy `19`;
  - ddev-executor remains `1.0.27`.
- PM-controlled routine merge is implemented and operationally proven. Developer agents never merge.
- Healthy-progress non-blocking remains mandatory: static task/profile/provider-failover counters alone are not Human Owner stop reasons while meaningful progress continues inside the approved resource envelope.
- On effective adaptive WorkOrders, `max_changed_files` is a semantic working target. Crossing it enters a bounded Product Manager reassessment; PM must be staffed with a different model from the Primary Developer and any approval is exact-diff-bound. Emergency overflow and actual sensitive/protected changed paths remain fail-closed boundaries. Legacy-hard WorkOrders retain strict file-count semantics.
- PM reassessment is repair-first for removable WorkOrder/out-of-scope implementation violations. Human Owner escalation requires a bounded necessity rationale showing why repair/revert/developer dialogue cannot resolve the boundary. A Human rejection of a PM-raised boundary requeues the same job for bounded repair without resetting workspace, diff, counters or WorkOrder.
- Protected diff signals such as dependency-manifest boundaries enter PM semantic reassessment before generic Router/Human escalation once deterministic verification passes. PM-directed repair returns immediately to the same Developer turn; generic Router cannot preempt that repair with the same protected signal.
- Routine provider recovery remains Runtime/Router responsibility while eligible capacity exists.
- Dedicated PCP BuildKit isolation is implemented through `pcp-builder`; the user's globally selected/default builder is not replaced.
- Direct workspace + Dashboard job-owned live preview for Chợ Nhạc is implemented and accepted.
- Project-level **Current site** preview is implemented and accepted independently of an active WorkOrder.
- Tiered Context & Memory Architecture is implemented through deterministic T0/T1 pinning plus bounded T2/T3 retrieval; vector/hybrid RAG is deferred because the current PCP benchmark passes without it.
- Current-site idle preview does not create an engineering job or hold the engineering project lease.
- Direct-job terminal cleanup must retire preview and safely return the exact clean job-owned branch to the configured existing local base branch before releasing the project lease.
- Terminal `completed/cancelled` jobs whose isolated Git workspace is already missing can now release exact orphaned PCP DDEV resources through a bounded inspect/revalidate/execute path; blocked/failed/nonterminal work remains ineligible.

For executable details, inspect code/tests on current `main`; historical rollout evidence is in `history/episodes.md`.

## Chợ Nhạc project state

Approved ProjectBaseline for new PCP-managed Chợ Nhạc work:

- revision: `mvp-v1-2026-09-27-governed`;
- immutable baseline source: `8383b0004ee649cb3ac0fef1e68f9ca40718005b`;
- document authority classes: Human Owner protected / delegated Design Owner / mutable execution / evidence-history;
- direct project root: `/home/sonvh/chonhac`;
- runtime mode: `workspace_mode: direct`;
- exclusive engineering lease: enabled;
- AI branch prefix: `ai`.

The immutable ProjectBaseline source is a governance baseline, not a claim that the live product repository must remain at that commit.

Last accepted live Current-site outcome from #309:

- Chợ Nhạc was clean on `main`;
- zero active engineering jobs;
- zero active Chợ Nhạc project leases;
- executor idle;
- Current site Frontend Ready at `https://chonhac.ddev.site:3100`;
- Backend URL `https://chonhac.ddev.site`.

Before any new mutation, re-read the live Chợ Nhạc branch/HEAD/worktree and Runtime lease/job state. Do not infer present state solely from this last-accepted snapshot.

Historical DEC-025 PCP orchestration is retired. Do not recreate, reroute or resume it; remaining/future DEC-025 evidence is Human Owner-managed in the Chợ Nhạc repository/operator workflow.

## Active PCP work

### #363 — Apply project auto-required verification to legacy jobs

Status: bounded platform correctness hotfix implemented locally; PM's first
review of `/tmp/issue-363-pm-review.patch` found one fail-closed edge case.
The bounded repair is pending PM review as
`/tmp/issue-363-pm-review-delta.patch`. No stage, commit, push or rollout.

The existing verification facade now resolves project-owned path-scoped
`ddev.auto_required_phases` after successful base verification for both legacy
jobs without a WorkOrder and WorkOrder-backed jobs. Matching project phases
remain additive to WorkOrder requirements; completed phases are not rerun.
All final required phases now have configured commands validated before phase
deduplication; a base phase with no executed-command evidence cannot satisfy
that requirement. Failing required phases still fail closed. Additional phases
retain final/required evidence and command counts without changing adaptive
budgets, verification-attempt accounting or review-repair churn metadata.

Final repaired-tree verification: focused Runtime verification/WorkOrder/budget/
review-repair tests `136` passed; full Runtime `656` passed (one existing
dependency deprecation warning); repository structure `103` passed;
`git diff --check` passed. The complete reviewed patch remains preserved and
the bounded repair is captured separately as the PM review delta.
Tests used the current checkout mounted read-only in disposable containers from
the existing Runtime image, with checkout `config/` at `/config` for Runtime.
Container Git used a process-local safe-directory override for structure tests.
Router/policy and ddev-executor source remain unchanged and their suites were
not rerun. No #357 sandbox work, #362 work, reviewer-policy changes or product
code changes. Running services and the live DS-1 job were not accessed for tests.

The preserved Chợ Nhạc DS-1 remains untouched. Supplied acceptance state (not
re-queried during this implementation): `waiting_human`, job
`06cd8e0b9c244ae6965b9db8ec4d2e8f`, branch `ai/06cd8e0b9c24`, workspace
`/home/sonvh/chonhac`, PR #38, request `fa1126e1c2204b2583ff613c0a8eb1a7`.
Churn generation is `0`, baseline repair/verification `45/47`, current `51/53`;
decision key is
`review_repair_churn:fa1126e1c2204b2583ff613c0a8eb1a7:generation:0`.
Do not authorize generation 1 or resume/modify this job during implementation.
Any later continuation requires separate PM review, merge, deliberate rollout
and the existing exact-key governed decision path.

### #146 — Efficiency initiative

Status: open for calibration/watch only.

Source phases A-F and clean low-touch validation are complete. Do not create synthetic jobs merely to close this umbrella.

Re-evaluate when at least one comparable natural project/task-type/role cohort reaches the configured minimum sample size (currently 5). Exclude validation fixtures, rollout/operator probes and deliberately adversarial recovery runs.

If calibration reveals a recurring concrete efficiency defect, open a narrow child issue rather than expanding #146 directly.

## Recently completed initiatives

The following are complete and no longer belong in active-state chronology:

- #224 healthy-progress executable alignment;
- #228 autonomous provider recovery;
- retired DEC-025C PCP orchestration;
- UI-CL-1 routing/review/repeated-failure/CI/supersession hardening;
- #277/#281 DDEV/BuildKit resource-hygiene initiative;
- #297 direct workspace + job-owned live preview;
- #309 project-level Current site preview;
- #313/#314/#317 tiered context/memory architecture, T1 compaction and deterministic Context Composer/evaluation;
- #282 bounded missing-workspace terminal DDEV resource release.
- #354 governed same-job delivered-PR review repair.
- #358 durable review-repair churn circuit breaker (merged via PR #361).

Their reusable lessons and primary references are in `history/episodes.md`. Git/issue/PR/Runtime history remains the detailed audit source.

## Global operational gates

- Normal engineering flow: issue -> bounded branch -> deterministic verification/CI -> PR -> PM review -> eligible PM merge.
- Never force push.
- Developer agents never merge.
- Human Owner retains protected scope/architecture/security/destructive-data/production/governance/material-budget authority.
- Production deployment is never implied by PR merge.
- Runtime durable execution state is authoritative; never hand-edit durable state to bypass the state machine.
- Do not restart/rebuild platform services while engineering work is active.
- Direct-workspace operations must preserve Human Owner changes; never reset/stash/clean/discard them to make automation succeed.
- Project-level idle preview must yield to the exact direct engineering lease before job workspace mutation.
- Potentially failing Human Owner shell blocks must run in an isolated function/subshell/process so they do not terminate the parent shell.
- Broad Docker/system/image/volume prune remains prohibited; cleanup must be bounded to proven PCP-owned resources.
- Time-sensitive claims such as active jobs, leases, branch/HEAD, PR/CI and service health must be checked live before acting.
- Approved ProjectBaseline authority stays pinned to its immutable revision/source commit until an explicitly approved successor revision is activated; newer project HEAD alone does not advance project-frame authority.
- PM merge evaluation treats `human_owner_protected` baseline document changes as a Human Owner decision boundary; delegated design authority remains bounded by its governing decision.

## Immediate next safe actions

1. Review the #363 local patch with PM. Keep it unstaged/uncommitted/unpushed until PM PASS; leave DS-1 and running PCP services untouched. CI remains a later mandatory merge gate.
2. Keep #146 in calibration/watch mode and collect only naturally occurring routine-task evidence.
3. Keep the deterministic context-memory evaluation in CI; treat a future recall/stale-authority regression or sustained corpus growth as evidence to reopen vector/hybrid retrieval evaluation.
4. Do not add a vector database or embedding provider without a new measured retrieval gap.
5. Keep shared/default BuildKit cache decisions separate from PCP-owned bounded GC and preserve unrelated Docker/DDEV resources.
6. For future terminal-resource cleanup, use the bounded Runtime/executor cleanup path; never use broad Docker/DDEV prune as a substitute.
