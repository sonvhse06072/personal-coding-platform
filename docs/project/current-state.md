# Current Project State and Handoff

Status: Tier-1 mutable working-state snapshot. Repository policy/code/tests and live Runtime/GitHub evidence remain authoritative over chat history. Completed chronology belongs in Tier-3 history, not here.

Last updated: 2026-09-29 for #367 canonical ticket intake PM review.

## Resume order

1. Read repository-root `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/project/README.md`.
3. Read this compact current-state snapshot.
4. Retrieve only the T2 topical documents and T3 episodes relevant to the current task.
5. Inspect live GitHub `main`, active issue/PR, local branch/worktree, Runtime/executor health and any current lease/job before mutation.
6. Fetch raw CI/log/transcript evidence only when the task requires diagnostics or audit.

Memory-tier rules and the proposed Context Composer contract are in `context-memory-architecture.md`. Historical platform lessons are indexed in `history/episodes.md`.

## Current platform snapshot

- Checked-out launch baseline: `798bc7b0170137daacb9524222e657c8f5f16dbd`
  (#366 merged via PR #372; #365 via PR #371).
- #362 PM rollout checkpoint confirms Runtime `1.0.72` active and the #367
  dependency gate open. No live-state mutation or rollout is part of #367.
- Current working-tree source identities on `ai/367-large-ticket-intake-policy`
  (unstaged/uncommitted; not rolled out):
  - Runtime `1.0.73`;
  - Router `1.0.30`;
  - routing policy `19`;
  - ddev-executor remains `1.0.27`.
- PM-controlled routine merge is implemented and operationally proven. Developer agents never merge.
- Healthy-progress non-blocking remains mandatory: static task/profile/provider-failover counters alone are not Human Owner stop reasons while meaningful progress continues inside the approved resource envelope.
- On effective adaptive WorkOrders, `max_changed_files` is a semantic working target. Crossing it enters a bounded Product Manager reassessment; PM must be staffed with a different model from the Primary Developer and any approval is exact-diff-bound. Emergency overflow and actual sensitive/protected changed paths remain fail-closed boundaries. Legacy-hard WorkOrders retain strict file-count semantics.
- PM reassessment is repair-first for removable WorkOrder/out-of-scope implementation violations. Human Owner escalation requires a bounded necessity rationale showing why repair/revert/developer dialogue cannot resolve the boundary. A Human rejection of a PM-raised boundary requeues the same job for bounded repair without resetting workspace, diff, counters or WorkOrder.
- Protected diff signals such as dependency-manifest boundaries enter PM semantic reassessment before generic Router/Human escalation once deterministic verification passes. PM-directed repair returns immediately to the same Developer turn; generic Router cannot preempt that repair with the same protected signal.
- Routine provider recovery remains Runtime/Router responsibility while eligible capacity exists.
- Dedicated PCP BuildKit isolation is implemented through `pcp-builder`; the user's globally selected/default builder is not replaced.
- Direct workspace + Dashboard job-owned live preview for Chợ Nhạc is implemented and accepted.
- Project-level **Current site** preview is implemented and accepted independently of an active WorkOrder.
- Tiered Context & Memory Architecture is implemented through deterministic T0/T1 pinning plus bounded T2/T3 retrieval; vector/hybrid RAG is deferred because the current PCP benchmark passes without it.
- Current-site idle preview does not create an engineering job or hold the engineering project lease.
- Direct-job terminal cleanup must retire preview and safely return the exact clean job-owned branch to the configured existing local base branch before releasing the project lease.
- Terminal `completed/cancelled` jobs whose isolated Git workspace is already missing can now release exact orphaned PCP DDEV resources through a bounded inspect/revalidate/execute path; blocked/failed/nonterminal work remains ineligible.

For executable details, inspect code/tests on current `main`; historical rollout evidence is in `history/episodes.md`.

## Chợ Nhạc project state

Approved ProjectBaseline for new PCP-managed Chợ Nhạc work:

- revision: `mvp-v1-2026-09-27-governed`;
- immutable baseline source: `8383b0004ee649cb3ac0fef1e68f9ca40718005b`;
- document authority classes: Human Owner protected / delegated Design Owner / mutable execution / evidence-history;
- direct project root: `/home/sonvh/chonhac`;
- runtime mode: `workspace_mode: direct`;
- exclusive engineering lease: enabled;
- AI branch prefix: `ai`.

The immutable ProjectBaseline source is a governance baseline, not a claim that the live product repository must remain at that commit.

Last accepted live Current-site outcome from #309:

- Chợ Nhạc was clean on `main`;
- zero active engineering jobs;
- zero active Chợ Nhạc project leases;
- executor idle;
- Current site Frontend Ready at `https://chonhac.ddev.site:3100`;
- Backend URL `https://chonhac.ddev.site`.

Before any new mutation, re-read the live Chợ Nhạc branch/HEAD/worktree and Runtime lease/job state. Do not infer present state solely from this last-accepted snapshot.

Historical DEC-025 PCP orchestration is retired. Do not recreate, reroute or resume it; remaining/future DEC-025 evidence is Human Owner-managed in the Chợ Nhạc repository/operator workflow.

## Active PCP work

### #362 / #367 — Canonical large-ticket intake

Status: WO-362-3 implemented locally on `ai/367-large-ticket-intake-policy`,
pending PM review. #366 is merged and rollout-accepted; parent #362 stays open.
Only #367 is in this patch. #368 publication, #369 blocked evidence pack and
#370 supervised continuation remain unimplemented and held.

Authenticated `/v1/intake` requires an approved baseline and uses deterministic
policy version `1`. Direct execution requires explicit bounded intent and known
semantic/scope evidence. Hard protected/dependency/multi-unit signals or two
independent material signals route to existing PM planning with required
decomposition. File count alone is insufficient. Unknown evidence routes to
planning without automatically forcing decomposition. Exact thresholds and API
semantics are documented in `operating-model.md`.

Material in-scope/no-boundary PM output must contain at least two WorkOrders;
single-unit output fails before readiness/registration/launch. Out-of-scope and
human-decision output needs no artificial work. Direct jobs atomically persist
compact intake evidence with their initial row before enqueue. `auto_run=false`
skips direct enqueue; planning retains the existing automatic registration/tick
path. Manual `/v1/jobs`, `create-job.sh`, `/run`, default single-unit `/v1/plans`,
PM bridge, #365 progress and #366 held/ready/launched reservations remain intact.

Verification: focused intake/planner/API/baseline/contract/orchestration/recovery/
checkpoint tests `290` passed; full Runtime `854` passed; repository structure
`103` passed; `git diff --check` passed. The full suite includes `43` real
PostgreSQL cases (all `37` existing #365/#366 cases plus `6` canonical-intake
integration cases), with no skipped database checks. Runtime reports one existing
Starlette/AnyIO dependency deprecation warning. The first structure run exposed a
generic-word collision in documentation retrieval; revising the new documentation
wording restored all checks without changing retrieval implementation or fixtures.
Tests use the existing Runtime image with read-only checkout/config mounts and a
separate disposable PostgreSQL instance; no live Runtime engineering state,
provider call or project workspace is used. Router/policy and executor source
remain unchanged. No staging, commit, push, PCP restart/rebuild or Chợ Nhạc
mutation is authorized. Handoff artifact: `/tmp/issue-367-pm-review.patch`, the
complete working-tree diff against HEAD including untracked files. Local tests
are not remote CI; exact-head CI and PM review remain required before merge.

### #146 — Efficiency initiative

Status: open for calibration/watch only.

Source phases A-F and clean low-touch validation are complete. Do not create synthetic jobs merely to close this umbrella.

Re-evaluate when at least one comparable natural project/task-type/role cohort reaches the configured minimum sample size (currently 5). Exclude validation fixtures, rollout/operator probes and deliberately adversarial recovery runs.

If calibration reveals a recurring concrete efficiency defect, open a narrow child issue rather than expanding #146 directly.

## Recently completed initiatives

The following are complete and no longer belong in active-state chronology:

- #224 healthy-progress executable alignment;
- #228 autonomous provider recovery;
- retired DEC-025C PCP orchestration;
- UI-CL-1 routing/review/repeated-failure/CI/supersession hardening;
- #277/#281 DDEV/BuildKit resource-hygiene initiative;
- #297 direct workspace + job-owned live preview;
- #309 project-level Current site preview;
- #313/#314/#317 tiered context/memory architecture, T1 compaction and deterministic Context Composer/evaluation;
- #282 bounded missing-workspace terminal DDEV resource release.
- #354 governed same-job delivered-PR review repair.
- #358 durable review-repair churn circuit breaker (merged via PR #361).
- #363 legacy auto-required verification (merged via PR #364).

Their reusable lessons and primary references are in `history/episodes.md`. Git/issue/PR/Runtime history remains the detailed audit source.

## Global operational gates

- Normal engineering flow: issue -> bounded branch -> deterministic verification/CI -> PR -> PM review -> eligible PM merge.
- Never force push.
- Developer agents never merge.
- Human Owner retains protected scope/architecture/security/destructive-data/production/governance/material-budget authority.
- Production deployment is never implied by PR merge.
- Runtime durable execution state is authoritative; never hand-edit durable state to bypass the state machine.
- Do not restart/rebuild platform services while engineering work is active.
- Direct-workspace operations must preserve Human Owner changes; never reset/stash/clean/discard them to make automation succeed.
- Project-level idle preview must yield to the exact direct engineering lease before job workspace mutation.
- Potentially failing Human Owner shell blocks must run in an isolated function/subshell/process so they do not terminate the parent shell.
- Broad Docker/system/image/volume prune remains prohibited; cleanup must be bounded to proven PCP-owned resources.
- Time-sensitive claims such as active jobs, leases, branch/HEAD, PR/CI and service health must be checked live before acting.
- Approved ProjectBaseline authority stays pinned to its immutable revision/source commit until an explicitly approved successor revision is activated; newer project HEAD alone does not advance project-frame authority.
- PM merge evaluation treats `human_owner_protected` baseline document changes as a Human Owner decision boundary; delegated design authority remains bounded by its governing decision.

## Immediate next safe actions

1. PM-review the #367 patch. Keep it unstaged/uncommitted/unpushed; exact-head CI remains a later mandatory merge gate. Leave running PCP services and Chợ Nhạc untouched. Do not begin #368–#370 in this work.
2. Keep #146 in calibration/watch mode and collect only naturally occurring routine-task evidence.
3. Keep the deterministic context-memory evaluation in CI; treat a future recall/stale-authority regression or sustained corpus growth as evidence to reopen vector/hybrid retrieval evaluation.
4. Do not add a vector database or embedding provider without a new measured retrieval gap.
5. Keep shared/default BuildKit cache decisions separate from PCP-owned bounded GC and preserve unrelated Docker/DDEV resources.
6. For future terminal-resource cleanup, use the bounded Runtime/executor cleanup path; never use broad Docker/DDEV prune as a substitute.
